Min SDK:    Marshmallow (Android 4.1) API Level 16

Intention:  Create an AR app that views the real-world and augments it with information or virtual objects
            that is related to real-world objects seen by the device. Specifically, using an Android device's
            camera, the real-world is  observed and captured while those capture images are processed to detect
            and identify objects. These objects are usually known, i.e. with information saved in some database
            such as how it looks like, and is only detected from the captured images using some image processing
            algorithm, i.e. OpenCV algorithms.
            
Current development:
            
            24-May-2017 I have only been able to create an app that accesses the camera and shows the preview.
            Next steo would be to capture imanges continuously and submit it for processing for detecting known
            objects. Finally, produce some augmentations (info, objects, etc.) via the same view to give an
            actual AR feel.
